## A database of MSPs for koshka 😸

<div align="justify">

This is a database of all **m**illi**s**econd **p**ulsars (**MSPs**) detected till date, maintained by *Elizabeth Ferrera*. It was originally created by *Duncan Lorimer*. It is maintained as both a simple webpage and a text file. This repository scraps the database as a text file and stores it as a [*JSON file*](galmsps.json) and as an [*SQLite database*](galmsps.db).

The latter powers the [**koshka 😸 project**][koshka].
