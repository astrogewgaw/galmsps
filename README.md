this is my own copy of the [**galactic MSPs database**](http://astro.phys.wvu.edu/GalacticMSPs/), which is maintained as a simple plain text file [**here**](http://astro.phys.wvu.edu/GalacticMSPs/GalacticMSPs.txt). the code to scrap the database is in the **scrap.py** file, and the database itself (in all its JSONic glory) is in the **galmsps.json** file. this repository will eventually power the **neko** package, which aims to make accessing all pulsar and radio transient related catalogues easier.
